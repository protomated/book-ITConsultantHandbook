\chapter{Your 90-Day Automation Action Plan}


\section{Introduction}

Welcome to your 90-day automation journey! This chapter will guide you through a comprehensive action plan to transform your IT consulting practice through automation. We'll break down the next three months into manageable bi-weekly segments, each building upon the last to help you progressively enhance your automation skills and deliver tangible results for your clients.

Throughout this journey, we'll focus on leveraging the key tools we've explored in this book: n8n for workflow automation, NoCoDB for database management, and BudiBase for creating custom applications. We'll also incorporate other complementary tools as needed to create a well-rounded automation toolkit.

Remember, the goal isn't just to learn these tools in isolation, but to apply them to real-world problems and create meaningful automations for your clients. By the end of these 90 days, you'll have completed several automation projects, integrated multiple systems, and significantly enhanced your capabilities as an IT consultant.

Let's start by outlining our key objectives for this 90-day plan:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete at least 6 automation projects (one every two weeks)
    \item Integrate at least 3 different systems or tools
    \item Achieve measurable improvements in efficiency (time saved) and client satisfaction
    \item Overcome common technical challenges in implementation and data integration
    \item Build a portfolio of successful automations to showcase to potential clients
\end{itemize}

\section{Weeks 1-2: Foundation and First Automation}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up your automation environment
    \item Complete your first basic automation project
    \item Establish baseline metrics for time spent on manual tasks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Steps}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Environment Setup}
Begin by setting up your automation toolkit:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Install and configure n8n locally or set up a cloud instance
    \item Set up a NoCoDB instance for data management
    \item Install BudiBase for creating custom applications
\end{itemize}

% TODO @screenshot: Show the setup screens for n8n, NoCoDB, and BudiBase side by side

\subsubsection{Step 2: Identify Your First Automation Project}
Choose a simple, high-impact task to automate. Consider starting with one of these:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Automate email responses for common client inquiries
    \item Create a simple task management system
    \item Set up automated reporting for a client project
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Implement Your First Automation}
Use n8n to create a workflow for your chosen task. Here's a basic example of an automated email response system:

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=3cm, auto]
            % Define styles
    \tikzstyle{process} = [rectangle, minimum width=3.5cm, minimum height=1.2cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=blue!20]
    \tikzstyle{decision} = [diamond, minimum width=4cm, minimum height=2cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=green!20]
    \tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]

    % Nodes
    \node (start) [process] {Email Received};
    \node (check) [decision, below of=start, yshift=-2cm] {Check Content};
    \node (auto) [process, below left of=check, xshift=-2cm, yshift=-2cm] {Send Auto-Response};
    \node (forward) [process, below right of=check, xshift=2cm, yshift=-2cm] {Forward to Team};
    \node (end) [process, below of=check, yshift=-5cm] {Mark as Handled};

    % Arrows
    \draw [arrow] (start) -- (check);
    \draw [arrow] (check) -- node[left, xshift=-0.5cm] {Common Query} (auto);
    \draw [arrow] (check) -- node[right, xshift=0.5cm] {Complex Issue} (forward);
    \draw [arrow] (auto) |- (end);
    \draw [arrow] (forward) |- (end);
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsubsection{Step 4: Measure and Record Baseline Metrics}
Before fully implementing your automation, measure how long the task takes manually. Record this in your progress tracker. This will be crucial for demonstrating the value of your automation efforts later.

\subsection{Check-In and Reflection}
At the end of week 2, reflect on your progress:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Did you successfully set up your environment?
    \item Have you completed your first automation project?
    \item What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
\end{itemize}


\section{Weeks 3-4: Expanding Your Toolkit}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrate NoCoDB into your automation workflows
    \item Complete a more complex automation project
    \item Start measuring time saved through automation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action Steps}

\subsubsection{Step 1: NoCoDB Integration}
Enhance your existing automation or create a new one that incorporates NoCoDB:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up a database in NoCoDB to store client information or project data
    \item Use n8n to create a workflow that reads from or writes to your NoCoDB database
\end{itemize}

% TODO @screenshot: n8n workflow showing integration with NoCoDB

\subsubsection{Step 2: Implement a More Complex Automation}

    \item Set up a workflow for collecting and analyzing client feedback
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Measure Time Savings}
Start tracking the time saved by your automations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compare the time taken for manual processes vs. automated ones
    \item Record these metrics in your progress tracker
    \item Calculate the potential time savings if applied across all your clients
\end{itemize}
