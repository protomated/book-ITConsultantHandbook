\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
    const influenceLevel = $input.body['Influence Level'];
    const goals = $input.body['Associated Goals'];

   let category = '';
   if (influenceLevel === 'High' && goals.length > 2) {
     category = 'Key Player';
   } else if (influenceLevel === 'High') {
     category = 'Meet Their Needs';
   } else if (goals.length > 2) {
     category = 'Keep Informed';
   } else {
     category = 'Monitor';
   }

   return {
     category: category,
     ...input.body
   };
\end{lstlisting}

4. Add a "Function" node to generate follow-up questions based on responses:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Javascript]
    const requirement = $input.body['Requirement'];
    const value = $input.body['Value'];

    let followUpQuestion = '';
    if (value.toLowerCase()
                .includes('efficiency')) {
    followUpQuestion = `How would improving efficiency in "${requirement}" impact your daily operations?`;
    } else if (value.toLowerCase().includes('cost')) {
    followUpQuestion = `Can you quantify the potential cost savings related to "${requirement}"?`;
    } else {
    followUpQuestion = `Could you elaborate on how "${value}" ties into your overall business objectives?`;
    }

    return { followUpQuestion };
\end{lstlisting}
